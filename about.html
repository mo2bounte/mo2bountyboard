        Mortal Bounty Board works like this: <br> Look around the board until you 
        find a bounty you like.  The bounties have lettering on them to symbolize their requirements.
        "H" stands for head, "V" stands for video, "LB" stands for Loot Bag screenshot, and "S" stands for special requirements
        (must dm the bounty's creator).
    <br>
    <br>
        To list a bounty, DM our discord .
        *All bounties rewards are held by us in advance.  MO2 Bounty Board will not list a bounty
        unless we have been given the gold (reward) by the bounty's creator.  
        <br>
        <br>
        To collect a bounty, send an email or DM our discord "OddworldMO2#9359" with proof
        that you completed all of the bounty's requirements, and we will give you a place to meet us
        in-game for your reward after verification.
        *All disputes concerning requirements between the bounty hunter and bounty creator will be settled
        in the bounty creator's favor (save rare instances), so make sure the bounty creator is someone
        you trust.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bounties are organized by creation date.  A completed bounty will be removed.  
        Do not submit the same bounty more than once a week.

        <br>

        Thanks and enjoy!
